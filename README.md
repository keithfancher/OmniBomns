OMNIBOMNS
=========

Bomns: the tap-happy, set-your-hair-on-fire, blow-up-your-friends, deathmatch
classic. In your browser!


WHAT THE HELL?
--------------
It's quite simple, really. Two players -- one red and one blue -- out for
blood. Attack your opponent with all of your might! A bomn (with an n!) does 5
damage, and "punching" your opponent (by running into them) does 1 damage.


CONTROLS
--------
Player 1:

  Movement:  Arrow keys
  Drop bomn: Enter

Player 2:

  Movement:  W, A, S, D
  Drop bomn: Spacebar


POWERUPS (AND POWERDOWNS)
-------------------------
There are powerups scattered around the level that give you more bomns, fill up
your health, and beef up your blast radius. There are also powerdowns that
*lower* your blast radius, so be careful! The yellow stars are invulnerability
powerups -- collect one and you'll be impervious to harm for 10 seconds.


WARPS
-----
Those multicolored swirly doo-dads are warps. Step into one and hope for the
best -- you'll be transported to a random part of the level. If you're lucky,
it won't be into the blast radius of a bomn!


REQUIREMENTS
------------
* A modern web browser (Chrome/Chromium seems to perform best) with...
* JavaScript enabled
* A keyboard (no touch events yet)
* A friend (or enemy) to battle
